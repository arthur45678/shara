<b>1. How the website works</b>
By using www.sharado.com (the “Site”), managed by Xandas s.r.l., the user may access job vacancies in the on-demand economy, for part-time, full-time, student and hourly jobs, including both those made available by Sharado’s clients by means of direct feeds, and those collected through other sources in Countries of the world.
Sharado also allows users to create their ‘Universal Profile’ which can be used both on the web site and outside, to apply for jobs and gigs with on-demand companies.
Sharado does not take responsibility as to the accuracy, truthfulness or updating of third parties’ job offers, accessed by means of the Site or the relevant Apps.
<b>2. Privacy policy</b>
This Privacy Policy describes the modalities and purposes through which Sharado carries out the processing of its Users’ personal data (the “data”).
This Privacy Policy is available to the Users pursuant to and in compliance with Section 13 of Legislative Decree No. 196/03 – Personal Data Protection Code (the “Privacy Code”), available at: 
http://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/1311248. 
<b>3. Data processing</b>
Sharado processes the data in compliance with the law, adopting adequate security measures able to prevent unauthorized accesses, dissemination, unauthorized alteration or destruction of the data.
<b>4. Purposes of data processing</b>
Users’ data will be processed exclusively for the following purposes:
a. Activation and operational management of the services Sharado offers to the Users and management of the respective administrative-accounting purposes; 
b. Information to Registered Users, by means of email communication to the email address provided by the User, in relation to new services offered by Sharado similar to the ones already requested by the Registered Users as well as new job opportunities similar to those for which the user has shown interest; 
c. Purposes connected to the fulfilment of obligations provided for by law, regulations, EU and national provisions, or deriving from orders imposed by legitimated authorities. 
<b>5. Informed consent on the part of the User</b>
With reference to the purposes under points above, disclosing that the data is voluntary but the failure to provide the same data will mean it will be impossible to obtain the service requested. 
With reference to the purposes under points of paragraph 4 above, in order to carry out the relevant processing operations, the consent of the Registered User is required. Such consent will be required at the time of registration and may be refused at any time, also partially; to this end, the communications sent by email will give the User the possibility to refuse further sending. The consent is voluntary, and the refusal to provide said consent will prevent the User from receiving communications, promotions, offers which according to Sharado may be of interest for the User and useful for their professional development, without prejudice, of course, to the possibility of using the services requested.
